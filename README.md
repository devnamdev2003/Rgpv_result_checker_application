>## Project Title: ***College Student Result Checker using Python***

**Description:** The goal of this project is to develop a Python-based system that allows college students to check their results online. The system will enable students to view their grades and academic performance for a given semester, including their GPA and any remarks from their teachers.

The system will be designed as a web application that students can access using their credentials. It will be developed using **`Python`** web framework **`Django`** , and will utilize a database to store student information and results.

The system will also include features such as search functionality, data visualization, and notifications for new results. It will be designed to be user-friendly and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
